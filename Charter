1] Availability for meeting expectations
2] Response time to communication expectations
3] Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
4] Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
5] Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates) if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
7] Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
 - Kiran's Suggestion: 
    1] Recognize work is not done before the deadline, SOLID principles are consistently violated, or not communicating:
      -) Contact members via email, discord, or text. 
    2] Notify member again for the last warning: 
      -) Do it in person to ensure they understand the consequences. 
    3] Try to come up with a workaround for the team member's circumstances.
      -) Require the team member to come up with solution or resources they need to accomplish the task


Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
Kiran, Alec, Joe, Kevin, Randall.
